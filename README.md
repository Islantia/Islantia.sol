In-game items are a big part of any video game and allow gamers to own digital assets. However, in-game items are centralized, not easily exchangeable, and challenging to implement. Islantia is a smart contract platform that allows game developers to mint, distribute and transact Smart NFTs representing in-game items. Smart NFTs are NFTs with dynamic properties that can change based on certain conditions. Smart NFTs are the next step to making decentralized in-game items mainstream and offer a massive range of potential opportunities that are not possible with traditional NFTs. We want to  create an easy-to-use interface and API for creating Smart NFTs, an open marketplace for transacting NFTs using the Islantia token, and we want to introduce truly random smart loot boxes to the blockchain.
